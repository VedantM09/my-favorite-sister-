        <hr> Initially, when I started talking to you 2yrs ago, I was looking for a person with sensible advice, but before I knew it, I found an elder sister, the best one- my favourite person in existence... every single moment spent with you is another one of my favourite memories, something as small as throwing pillows on you and getting my ass kicked in the kitchen (ouch that hurt btw) and also that one day when I just sat next to you as you unwrapped Spotify whilst taking away all my boards stress... you're my human medicine and my laughing pill and my problem solver and so many more things that words cannot express... nothing I tell you will even cover 1/4 of what you mean to me but I'm sure you already know it all... You make my world a better place by simply being in it which sometimes really makes me wonder if you're an angel with hidden wings... I love you so so so fucking much and have an amazing birthday <3</p2> </b>
